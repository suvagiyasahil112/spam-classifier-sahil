Project Title: SMS Spam Classifier

Project Description:

The SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning-based web application that automatically detects whether a given text message is spam or ham (legitimate). The goal of this project is to help users and organizations prevent unwanted or fraudulent messages by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms.

The model is trained on a labeled SMS dataset containing thousands of messages. It uses text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization (TF-IDF) to transform raw text into meaningful numerical features. Various classification algorithms (like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM) are tested, and the best-performing model is deployed for real-time predictions.

A simple and interactive Streamlit web interface allows users to input any message and instantly check whether it is spam or not.
